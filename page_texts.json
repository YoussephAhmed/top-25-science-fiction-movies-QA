At the heart of the picture\nis Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb, a stricken widower who specializes in a\nform of corporate espionage that involves stealing information from a\nmark's mind while they sleep. Of course, as good as Cobb is at his job, it's\nhis own dreams -- including appearances by his dead wife (Marion\nCotillard) -- that are his biggest challenge.\nBuoyed by a great cast (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, Tom\nHardy, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine), stunning visual effects and\nthose rarest of Hollywood commodities -- an original and intelligent script\n-- Inception is a no-brainer for this list.

This\nfamily(ish)-friendly sci-fi classic sees Michael J. Fox's Marty accidentally\ndrive himself back to 1955. Before he can get home, he has to deflect his\nmother's romantic advances, ensure his parents fall in love, and do\nsomething about that bully Biff.\nTime travel hijinks have never been as enjoyable as they are with Marty\nMcFly, and the movie inspired two sequels that saw ever-more\ncomplicated problems arise in the timestream. The franchise as a whole\nwas far more consistently entertaining than many sci-fi series, but we still\nfavor the original above all others.\n18. Close Encounters of the Third Kind\n(1977)\n",

It's a hallmark the director would revisit in such\nfilms as E.T. and 2005's War of the Worlds. Moreover, the movie's\nmessaging is that -- despite what most movies tell us -- not all aliens are\nmalevolent.\nThe script, written by Spielberg, has some issues that don't hold up as\nwell as the movie's impressive spectacle, but overall Encounters earns its\nplace here for reminding us that good sci-fi doesn't have to have\nexplosions or aliens slaughtering people.\n",

After all, it's the movie that\ninserted the phrase \"Klaatu barada nikto\" into the pop-culture lexicon!\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still was designed to be a thinking fan's sci-fi\nfilm. Instead of epic space battles and evil empires, the film featured a\nvisiting alien named Klaatu. Klaatu arrives on Earth with a peaceful but\nstern warning: Should humanity extend its penchant for violence into the\nstars, they'll be struck down.\nIt attracted a fair amount of controversy in its day.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\nTerminator 2 is a solid example of a sequel coming along and just\ndestroying the original in every regard. In this follow-up to the original,\nSkynet sends back an advanced, liquid metal-based Terminator to\ndestroy John Connor once and for all. Connor's only hope is the T-800 --\na reprogrammed version of the same machine that once nearly\nsucceeded in killing his mother.\nT2 is host to some truly epic action and chase sequences. Over 30 years\nlater, the film puts most action movies to shame. But where T2 truly earns\nits enduring status is in its heart and thoughtful message. This James\nCameron movie was all about the notion that the future is not set in stone,\nand that people can rewrite their destinies if they so choose. Even a cold\nmachine can learn what it means to love and feel emotion.\n",

Actually, those no good, dirty Commies\nwant to, or wanted to back in 1956 when Don Siegel's sci-fi/horror Cold\nWar cautionary tale, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, first scared the\nbejesus out of Reds-fearing Americans everywhere.\nThe film stars Kevin McCarthy as Miles Bennell, a small-town doctor who\ndiscovers a quiet epidemic in the making -- many of his patients believe\nthat their loved ones have been replaced by impostors.

You're next!\" Funny\nthing is, in the years after the film's success, the filmmakers usually\ndenied that the movie was meant to be anything more than a sci-fi\nscarefest. But we know better.\n14.

What is reality? Is the world around us an illusion? Whose kung\nfu is strongest? The film yearned to be more intelligent and thoughtful\nthan the average action movie, yet it was never afraid to put aside the\nmusing for some well-choreographed bullet-dodging and martial arts\nmayhem. The Matrix's slow-motion combat ballet inspired legions of\nimitators, but none have lived up to the original, not even the Matrix\nsequels.\nRead our review of The Matrix or check out our guide to watching the\nMatrix movies in order.\n4.

    "page 27": "11/24/23, 11:42 AM\nThe 25 Best Sci Fi Movies of All Time - IGN\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/best-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time\n27/41\nThe tagline \"In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream\" defined the Alien\nfilm series. It was Ridley Scott's movie that first pit Warrant Officer Ripley\nagainst the acid-bleeding xenomorph, and while on the surface Alien is a\n\"monster in the house\" creature feature, here the house is a spaceship\nand the monster is a mouth-tongued beastie that lays eggs and uses\npeople's chests as doors.\nThe fun here is that the science fiction goes less Star Trek and Star Wars,\nand more gritty, which makes the scares more urgent, more real. This is a\nfuture where ships look more like oil derricks than the Enterprise. Putting\na blue-collar crew in the middle of our first truly great \"monster in space\"\nmovie created a new subset of the genre, one that Hollywood has milked\never since with less-than-consistent results.\nAlien changed the careers of both its director and leading lady. It\nintroduced one of the best movie monsters ever. And it reminded us how\ngreat the genre can be when it combines expert storytelling with new and\ndifferent concepts. And mouth tongues.\n3.

But in terms of pure science fiction action and adventure,\nnothing can top the original Star Wars.\nA New Hope wowed viewers from the opening shot of the Star Destroyer\npursuing the fleeing Rebel ship to the final ceremony where Luke\nSkywalker and Han Solo were crowned as galactic heroes. In between\nthese two points was everything a sci-fi/fantasy fan could hope for:\nhumble heroes pulled into larger worlds, roguish scoundrels, princesses in\nperil, a menagerie of weird and wonderful aliens, and epic space battles\nthat held the fates of planets in the balance.\nWith A New Hope, George Lucas took everything that was great about the\nclassic adventure serials of the early 20th century and updated that with\na modern flourish. It is not the most complex or dense of the Star Wars\nmovies. It's simply the most pure fun anyone can hope to have watching a\nmovie.\n2. Blade Runner (1982)\n",

Their creation? An\nartificial intelligence more human than human, forced into slave labor and\nborn with a ticking-clock expiration date. It is up to an ex-cop by the\nname of Deckard, an ex-Blade Runner, to put down a group of these\nrenegade Replicants. This is the bare-bones context in which Ridley\nScott's masterpiece resides. Surrounding that core conceit is the stuff\nthat great sci-fi is made of, moral and ethical themes that are not easy to\nnavigate and are even more difficult to satisfy dramatically on screen.\nUsing Philip K. Dick's source material as a blueprint to build a detective\nstory around that which wants to be about more than just Deckard\ncatching his prey, Scott effortlessly knows how to tell this story -- you\nfeel it in every shot, every cut, every music cue. Scott and his production\nteam create a future Los Angeles built on neon and skyscrapers that stab\na permanent rain-streaked sky. From the top down, Blade Runner is film\nnoir science fiction -- as unique and alive as the androids its protagonist\nmust retire. The film's impact on visual storytelling cannot go\nunmentioned.\nBlade Runner is also a classic and triumph of the genre because no\nsingular viewing delivers the same experience; you'll notice a new detail\nhere or catch a different subtext in a line of dialogue there. You'll think you\nget the message of the movie, but then you realize you're just touching\nthe surface. It may a take a few more years and a touch more hindsight\nfor Blade Runner 2049 to crack this list, but Denis Villeneuve's sequel, 35-\nyears after the fact, is also a visual feast that expertly expands on the\noriginal.\n1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n",

Oh, it's also about the evolution of man from ape to Something\nElse.\nTechnically masterful and innovative, thematically challenging and\nenthralling, visually and aurally exquisite and unforgettable, 2001 is\neverything a great sci-fi movie should be.
